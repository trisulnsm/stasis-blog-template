h3. What happened to the missing packets

We banged our heads for a couple of days trying to figure out what was going on. We confirmed the following

  *  Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque 
  *  voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat
  *  The cable directly connected the switch from upstream end to Trisul
  *  voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat

It turns out the SNMP stats were produced by polling the ifHCInOctets/ifHCOutOctets counters in mib-2 interfaces group.  For Ethernet interfaces this is what RFC 3635 says.

bq.. 
    The Interface MIB octet counters, ifInOctets, ifOutOctets,

    ifHCInOctets and ifHCOutOctets, MUST include all octets in valid frames sent or received on the interface, including the MAC header and FCS, but not the preamble, start of frame delimiter, or extension octets.

p. 
     

Note that the 7 byte preamble + 1 byte SFD isnt included, just the 4 byte CRC.

Trisul of course did not see the CRC because we were relying on the PF_PACKET mechanism to supply packets. Once we added the 4 bytes to every packet we found that the numbers tallied.


h3. How to compensate for FCS

Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man
